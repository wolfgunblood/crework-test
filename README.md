## Design Patterns

<img src="frontend/public/design-patterns.jpeg" alt="Banner Image for Design pattern" width="300">
</div>

**Maintainability** - I have tried to keep components modular and scalable and dynamic, with an emphasis on reusability and readability.

**Dynamic fetch function** - I have created two highly flexible server functions to handle all the data fetching necessary for the application.

**Type Safety** - The use of types and interfaces is constant throughout the app, without a single use of the word 'any' to override the type check.

**File and folder structure** - The app is organised to seperate components based on their role, as well as separating types, utils, server functions and constants.

**Saving and committing work often** - I regularly made commits and pull requests to github using a total of 36 pull requests with clear commit messages. This keeps the project organised and allows me to work on tasks without altering the main codebase.
